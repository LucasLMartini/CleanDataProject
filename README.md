# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This is the repository for Lucas' **Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project!**

The script "run_analysis.R" takes data from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and generates a tidy data set in the file named "dataAvgs.txt".

You can find detailed information about what the script does in the repo's codebook, enjoy!
